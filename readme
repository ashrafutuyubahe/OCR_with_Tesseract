# Printed Text Scanner GUI - OCR Without ML

A PyQt5-based GUI application that uses classical OCR (Tesseract) to extract text from printed images. This project demonstrates AI techniques without machine learning, focusing on image preprocessing and traditional computer vision.

## Features

- **Multiple Input Methods**: Load images from file or capture from live camera
- **ROI Selection**: Click and drag to select a region of interest on the image
- **Real-time Preprocessing**: Adjust contrast and threshold values with live feedback
- **OCR Text Extraction**: Extract text using Tesseract OCR engine
- **Live Camera Input**: Stream from webcam and perform OCR on camera feed
- **Text Display & Copy**: View extracted text and copy to clipboard
- **Preprocessing Pipeline**: Automatic image binarization, inversion, and enhancement

## Requirements

### System Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Windows/Linux/MacOS
- Tesseract OCR engine installed

### Python Dependencies
```bash
PyQt5>=5.15.0
opencv-python>=4.5.0
pytesseract>=0.3.10
numpy>=1.19.0
```

## Installation

### 1. Install Tesseract OCR Engine

**Windows:**
- Download installer from: https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
- Run the installer (default path: `C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR`)
- Note the installation path for later

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
```bash
sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr
```

**MacOS:**
```bash
brew install tesseract
```

### 2. Clone Repository and Install Python Dependencies

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ocr-text-scanner.git
cd ocr-text-scanner

# Create virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# Linux/MacOS:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure Tesseract Path (Windows Only)

Edit `main.py` and update the Tesseract path if needed:
```python
pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r"C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe"
```

## Usage

### Running the Application

```bash
python main.py
```

### How to Use

1. **Load Image Method:**
   - Click "Load Image" button
   - Select a printed text image from your computer
   - (Optional) Click and drag on the image to select ROI

2. **Camera Method:**
   - Click "Start Camera" tab
   - Click "Start Camera" button
   - Position camera over printed text
   - (Optional) Select ROI by clicking and dragging

3. **Adjust Preprocessing:**
   - Use "Contrast" slider (0-255) for image brightness
   - Use "Threshold" slider (0-255) for binarization level

4. **Extract Text:**
   - Click "Run OCR" button
   - Wait for processing to complete
   - Extracted text appears in right panel

5. **Copy Results:**
   - Click "Copy Text" to copy extracted text to clipboard

## How It Works

### Image Preprocessing Pipeline

1. **Color Space Conversion**: Convert BGR image to grayscale
2. **Background Detection**: Determine if background is light or dark
3. **Inversion**: Invert colors if needed for better contrast
4. **Contrast Enhancement**: Scale pixel values for better definition
5. **Binarization**: Convert to black and white using threshold value
6. **OCR**: Feed processed image to Tesseract

### Key Components

- **OCRPreprocessor**: Handles all image preprocessing and text extraction
- **ImageLabel**: Custom widget for ROI selection with live visualization
- **OCRScannerGUI**: Main application window with tabs and controls

## Troubleshooting

### "Tesseract is not installed" Error
- Ensure Tesseract is installed on your system
- Verify the path in `main.py` matches your installation location
- On Windows, default path is `C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe`

### Camera Not Working
- Check if your webcam is connected and working
- Close other applications using the camera
- Ensure you granted camera permissions

### Poor OCR Results
- Adjust Contrast slider (increase for better definition)
- Adjust Threshold slider (try values between 50-150)
- Ensure image has good lighting
- Position text parallel to camera
- Select ROI around the text area

### PyQt5 Import Error
```bash
pip install --upgrade PyQt5
```

## Performance Tips

- Use high-quality images (300+ DPI recommended)
- Ensure good lighting on printed text
- Keep text parallel to camera for live input
- Use ROI selection to focus on text area only
- Adjust threshold value based on image quality
